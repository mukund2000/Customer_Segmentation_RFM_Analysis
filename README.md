# Customer_Segmentation_RFM_Analysis
RFM is a data-driven customer segmentation technique that allows marketers to take tactical decisions. It empowers marketers to quickly identify and segment users into homogeneous groups and target them with differentiated and personalized marketing strategies.

# RFM ANALYSIS
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.

# RFM Factors
RFM factors illustrate these facts:
1. the more recent the purchase, the more responsive the customer is to promotions
2. the more frequently the customer buys, the more engaged and satisfied they are
3. monetary value differentiates heavy spenders from low-value purchasers
